Revision history for Pod-Weaver-Section-Badges

{{$NEXT}}
 [API Changes]
 - This version has a completely different (and better) way to add badges:
 - There are now *no* built-in badges, all badges are separate and in the Badge::Depot::Plugin namespace.
 - There is now *no* way to make on-the-fly custom badges. The api was non-intuitive, and since it is so easy to create a new badge it is now of little use.
