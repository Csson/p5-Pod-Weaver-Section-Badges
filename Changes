 [Enhancements]
 - New attribute 'skip_markdown_if_html' doesn't produce '=begin markdown'
   blocks if both html and markdown are set as formats. Some (all?)
   markdown renderers also render html blocks. This avoids duplicating the
   badges.
 - Badges are now rendered one-per-line. This ensures that lines aren't
   overly long when using many badges.

 [Enhancements]
 - Can now be used without Dist::Zilla (#3, thanks MGRIMES).

0.0300 2016-01-26T18:25:47Z UTC
 [Other Changes]
 - Rebuilt with current Dist::Iller::Config::Author::CSSON.

 [Requirements]
 - Remove Moops dependency (should now work on 5.10+).
 - New (explicit) prereqs: namespace::autoclean, Types::Standard.

 [Testing]
 - Fix year dependent test (#2, thanks SREZIC).

0.0203 2015-04-11T23:58:00Z CEST
 [Documentation]
 - Removed documentation for the internal 'badge_args' attribute, and
   instead:
 - Added a section of documentation describing a bit more how badges are
   rendered given the synopsis (and compared to using Badge::Depot
   directly).

0.0202 2015-03-23T18:01:15Z CET
 [Enhancements]
 - Renamed the plugin searcher class so that it is under the
   Pod::Weaver::Section::Badges namespace.

 [Requirements]
 - Runtime: Listed List::AllUtils
 - Test: Listed Syntax::Feature::Qi

0.0201 2015-03-21T16:56:08Z CET
 [Documentation]
 - Corrected abstract.

0.0200 2015-03-21T16:49:20Z CET
 [API Changes]
 - This version has a completely new (and better) way to choose badges:
 - There are now *no* built-in badges, all badges are separate and in the
   Badge::Depot::Plugin namespace.
 - There is now *no* way to make on-the-fly custom badges. The api was
   non-intuitive, and since it is so easy to create a new badge it is now
   of little use.

 [Requirements]
 - Added a few test prereqs.
 - Added Module::Pluggable as a runtime prereq.
 - Added Pod::Weaver::Role::AddTextToSection as a runtime prereq.

 [Testing]
 - Changed test to test for multiple badges.

0.0101 2015-02-15T16:24:15Z CET
 [Documentation]
 - Fixed link to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TravisCI::StatusBadge under See Also.

 [Requirements]
 - Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodWeaver is now listed as a test prereq.
 - Added DZP::ReportPrereqs to dist.ini.

0.0100 2015-02-14T02:18:15Z CET
 - Initial release
